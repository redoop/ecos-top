📋 ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================
✅ Signal Consistency: GOOD - Key SimpleEdgeAiSoC signals present in both
✅ Timing Consistency: GOOD - Similar simulation duration
✅ Size Relationship: EXPECTED - Integrated version appropriately larger

🎯 Overall Consistency Score: 3/3 (100%)
✅ CONCLUSION: Integration is CONSISTENT - SimpleEdgeAiSoC behaves similarly in both configurations

📝 RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. ✅ Integrated version is larger as expected (includes ASIC wrapper)
2. ✅ Integrated version has more signals (ASIC hierarchy)
3. 🔍 Use GTKWave to visually compare key SimpleEdgeAiSoC signals
4. 📊 Verify that SimpleEdgeAiSoC internal behavior is identical
5. ⚡ Check that ASIC wrapper doesn't introduce timing delays
